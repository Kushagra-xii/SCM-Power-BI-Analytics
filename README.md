# SCM-Power-BI-Analytics

This project presents a comprehensive Supply Chain Management Dashboard built using Power BI for a fashion and beauty startup. Based on a rich dataset covering inventory, orders, shipping, suppliers, costs, and customer demographics, the solution is structured into three focused dashboards:

Executive Dashboard – Highlights key business KPIs including total revenue, units sold, inventory levels, and order volumes to provide leadership with a quick overview of operational performance.

Shipping & Delivery Dashboard – Visualizes logistics metrics such as average shipping time, carrier performance, transit costs, and route coverage to monitor and optimize transportation efficiency.

Consumer Dashboard – Focuses on customer segmentation, sales trends, product demand, and order behavior across different demographics to support targeted decision-making.

The project includes the creation of calculated DAX measures, interactive visualizations, and filterable reports to deliver actionable insights across all facets of the supply chain.
